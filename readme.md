<h1 style="color:#4A90E2;">🌐 What is Client-Server Web Architecture?</h1>

Client-Server Web Architecture is a <span style="color:#D35400; font-weight:bold;">network design framework</span> in which the workload is distributed between two main entities: the <span style="color:#27AE60;"><b>client</b></span> and the <span style="color:#C0392B;"><b>server</b></span>.  
It is the fundamental model used for communication over the web.

---

## <span style="color:#27AE60;">🖥️ Client</span>

A <span style="color:#27AE60;"><b>client</b></span> is a device or application that initiates communication by <span style="color:#2980B9;"><b>sending a request</b></span> to the server.  
💡 **Examples**: Web browsers, mobile apps, desktop software.

---

## <span style="color:#C0392B;">🗄️ Server</span>

A <span style="color:#C0392B;"><b>server</b></span> is a device or application that <span style="color:#2980B9;"><b>receives the client's request</b></span>, processes it, and <span style="color:#2980B9;"><b>sends back a response</b></span>.  
💡 **Examples**: Web servers, application servers, database servers.

---

## <span style="color:#9B59B6;">🔄 Request-Response Lifecycle</span>

1. 🟢 The client initiates a request (e.g., opening a webpage).  
2. 📡 The request is sent over the internet.  
3. 📥 The request reaches its destination — the <span style="color:#C0392B;"><b>server</b></span>.  
4. 🔐 The server <b>authorizes and validates</b> the request.  
5. 📤 If valid, the server processes it and <span style="color:#27AE60;"><b>sends back an appropriate response</b></span>.

---

## <span style="color:#F39C12;">📝 Additional Note</span>

The internet uses <span style="color:#8E44AD;"><b>packet-switching technology</b></span>,  
which breaks data into smaller packets, sends them independently across the network,  
and reassembles them at the destination.  
This makes communication more <b>efficient</b> and <b>reliable</b>.


 <h1 style="color:#4A90E2;">🌐 Types of Web Architecture</h1>

Web architecture is classified into tiers (or layers) based on how the **presentation**, **logic**, and **data** are separated across systems. Below are the main types:

---

## <span style="color:#1ABC9C;">1️⃣ One-Tier Architecture (1-Tier)</span>

All components — user interface, business logic, and data storage — exist on the **same machine**.  
🛠️ Typically used for standalone desktop applications.  
🔒 Not suitable for large-scale or multi-user web applications.

> 💡 **Example**: A local MS Access database application.

---

## <span style="color:#3498DB;">2️⃣ Two-Tier Architecture (2-Tier)</span>

Divides the system into two layers:
- **Client** (presentation + business logic)
- **Server** (database)

The client directly communicates with the database server.  
🟡 Simple but can lead to scalability issues.

> 💡 **Example**: Java application directly connected to a MySQL server.

---

## <span style="color:#9B59B6;">3️⃣ Three-Tier Architecture (3-Tier)</span>

Has three separate layers:
1. **Presentation Tier** – User interface (browser, app UI)
2. **Application Tier** – Business logic (backend server)
3. **Data Tier** – Database server

✅ Most common web architecture.  
🎯 Scalable, secure, and maintainable.

> 💡 **Example**: React frontend → Node.js backend → MongoDB database

---

## <span style="color:#E67E22;">🔢 N-Tier Architecture</span>

An advanced extension of 3-tier where more specialized layers are added, like:
- Caching layer
- API gateway
- Load balancer
- Microservices

🏗️ Used in large, enterprise-level, distributed systems.  
⚙️ Each tier is independent, allowing better scaling and fault isolation.

> 💡 **Example**: Netflix-like architecture using microservices, API gateway, and database shards.
