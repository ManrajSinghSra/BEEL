compiler create a new file but not interpreter 

generally used common js and ecma script module=mjs
each seperate file is called module



2 type in build and custom build module
 http fs os path event process

any function created inside a module is limited to the scope of the module

object pass when need multiple functions
if single module.exports=greet
