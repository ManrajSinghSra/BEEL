# What is Client-Server Web Architecture?

Client-Server Web Architecture is a **network design framework** in which the workload is distributed between two main entities: the **client** and the **server**. It is the fundamental model used for communication over the web.

## Client

A **client** is a device or application that initiates communication by **sending a request** to the server.  
Examples: Web browsers, mobile apps, desktop software.

---

## Server

A **server** is a device or application that **receives the client's request**, processes it, and **sends back a response**.  
Examples: Web servers, application servers, database servers.

## Request-Response Lifecycle

1. The client initiates a request (e.g., opening a webpage).  
2. The request is sent over the internet.  
3. The request reaches its destination â€” the **server**.  
4. The server **authorizes and validates** the request.  
5. If valid, the server processes it and **sends back an appropriate response**.

## Additional Note

The internet uses **packet-switching technology**, which breaks data into smaller packets, sends them independently across the network, and reassembles them at the destination. This makes communication more efficient and reliable.
