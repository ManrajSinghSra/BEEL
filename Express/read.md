what is express

express is a light weight framework used at backend with node js to create  the server handle the request api's.

we will use js in express also it behaves asynchronously 


advantages and disadvatages are
  mininal and fast = it do not take much time easy to use 
  easy to learn =  handling of api is easy 
  middleware support middleware are the functions that have direct access to req res lifecycle
  flexible does not follow any particular structure 
  huge ecosystem assces to thousand 
  cross platform linux window and mac it support all 3 platform
  restapi and ssr can also d


disadvantage
 do not follow a strict format == beacause it is uncordinated  therefore it might be the case that another who is writing the code might have prorblem to undrestand

 it rely's on packages some features have to be settled manually 

 also have callback problem 
 work as a single threaded to work 

    A thread is like a lightweight process that runs part of your program — it allows your code to do multiple things at once.
